Keratoconus is a rare disorder that can be both genetic or induced. Keratoconus occurs when the cornea (the outer layer of the eye) thins out and begins to form a bulge outwards.  Keratoconus begins to appear in during teen years particularly throughout puberty, yet many people do not know they keratoconus and allow the disorder to develop and in many cases cause heavy vision impairment. Fortunatly treatments such as corneal crosslinkikng allow for the impedement of the development of keratoconus. These methods do not cure keratoconus which is why it is important to identify keratoconus at an early stage.
