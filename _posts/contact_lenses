As a keratoconus patient I had to go through many contact lenses to find the right ones for me. This blog post describes the specific challenges I had with each contact lense beginning with soft lenses.


##Soft Lenses

Before I had the cross-linking and before I even knew I had keratoconus I had soft contact lenses. These contacts, as expected, felt nice on my eyes and I had little to no problems with allergies of any sort. The problem was that my prescription changed super quickly in a short period of time which led to me changing the prescription every couple of months. After we realized I had keratoconus we had to switch to scleral lenses because soft lense simply do not provide enough support for cornea. 

##Scleral Lenses

After I had my cross-linking I switched to scleral lenses for about 3 years and I have mixed feelings about them. Scleral lenses greatly increased my vision and allowed me to get 25/20 in both eyes which I was very happy about. Yet with all the positives, scleral lenses flared my allergies and ended up causing Giant Papillary Conjunctivitis (GPC) which made it very difficult to wear the contacts for long periods of time. On top of this, the scleral lenses collected lots of residue from my allergies (such as mucus) and further flared the GPCs.
