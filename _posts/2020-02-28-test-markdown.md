I found out officially I had keratoconus at the age of 14, this blog post is  about how I found out about my keratoconus and the struggles my family and I had to go trhough to solve it.
**This blog post will be split into two parts, part one finding out about keratoconus, and part two cross-linking.**

## Finding out about keratoconus

I was 14 around the time where I started to see large changes in my eyesight, I of course did not know how or why they were happening.

How about a yummy crepe?

It can also be centered!

Here's a code chunk:

~~~
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
~~~

And here is the same code with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
```

And here is the same code yet again but with line numbers:

{% highlight javascript linenos %}
var foo = function(x) {
  return(x + 5);
}
foo(3)
{% endhighlight %}
