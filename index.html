subtitle: Raising Awareness About Keratoconus From a Patient's Perspective
subtitle: Keratoconus is when the cornea thins out causing it to bulge like a cone. This leads to distorted vision which makes daily tasks difficult such as a driving and reading. Keratoconus can be caused by heavy eye rubbing, genetics, and heavy allergies.
